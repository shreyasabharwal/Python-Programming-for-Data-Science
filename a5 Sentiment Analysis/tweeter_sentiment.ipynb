    "# a5 - Tweeter Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will write a program to perform simple [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) of Twitter data&mdash;that is, determining the \"attitude\" or \"emotion\" (e.g., how \"positive\", \"negative\", \"joyful\", etc) of tweets made by a particular Twitter user. Sentiment analysis is a fascinating field: researchers have shown that the \"mood\" of Twitter communication [reflects biological rhythms](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/science/30twitter.html) and can even be used to [predict the stock market](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3003&embedded=true). The particular analysis you'll be performing is inspired by an investigation of [personal vs. organizational tweets](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) (which has become less amusing over time).\n",

    "You will be implementing a Python program that performs this analysis on **real data** taken directly from a Twitter user's timeline. In the end, your script will produce output similar to the following:\n",
