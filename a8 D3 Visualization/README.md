For this assignment we decided to uptake a dataset from the World Bank’s global population estimates and projections data. They are disaggregated by gender.

The results are visualized using an interactive area chart that illustrates how the population of people in 174 world economies has changed from 2009-2018.

### INTRICACIES

The user can:
• click on a particular country to further drill down details only for that country and see how population changed over the years represented by another area chart.
• search for a particular country in the textbox to see results for individual countries, instead of clicking from the area chart of all countries.
• bifurcate the visualization based on gender and visualize the results for both, or male or female for a particular country which is entered in the textbox.
• also visualize pattern for male and female for all the countries using the respective radio buttons.
• see the country names by hovering over the area chart.

The countries are grouped into seven regions which were merged from another dataset from sociology. These regions are represented by a different color which are illustrated using a legend.
